5. Boolean Calculator (1)
    Create a program that functions as a simple boolean calculator for 32-bit integers. It should display a menu that asks the user to make 
    a selection from the following list:
      1. x AND y
      2. x OR y
      3. NOT x
      4. x XOR y
      5. Exit program
    When the user makes a choice, call a procedure that displays the name of the operation about to be performed. You must implement this 
    procedure using the Table-Driven Selection technique, shown in Section 6.5.4. (You will implement the operations in Exercise 6.)(The 
    Irvine32 library is required for this solution program.)

.code
main proc

	;display menu
	mov rdx





	call Cr1f

	mov rdx, OFFSET menu4
	call WriteString
	call Cr1f

	mov rdx, OFFSET menu5
	call WriteString
	call Cr1f

	mov rdx, OFFSET prompt
	call WriteString
	mov rdx, OFFSET choice
	mov rcx, 2
	call ReadString

	mov rbx, OFFSET caseTable
	mov rcx, numberOfEntries
	movzx r8, BYTE PTR [choice]
	
	L1:
		movzx r9, BYTE PTR [rbx]
		cmp r8, r9
		jne L2
		call NEAR PTR [rbx + 1]
		call WriteString
		call Cr1f
		jmp L3
	L2:
		add rbx, entrySize
		loop L1
	L3:
		call ExitProcess

	mov ecx, 0
	call ExitProcess

	mov rdx, OFFSET msgA

Process_B PROC
	mov rdx, OFFSET msgB
	call WriteString

Process_B ENDP

6. Boolean Calculator (2)
    Continue the solution program from Exercise 5 by implementing the following procedures:
      AND_op: Prompt the user for two hexadecimal integers. AND them together and display the result in hexadecimal.
      OR_op: Prompt the user for two hexadecimal integers. OR them together and display the result in hexadecimal.
      NOT_op: Prompt the user for a hexadecimal integer. NOT the integer and display the result in hexadecimal.
      XOR_op: Prompt the user for two hexadecimal integers. Exclusive-OR them together and display the result in hexadecimal.
    (The Irvine32 library is required for this solution program.)
